  Developers today accomplish incredible things with programming, a highly delicate art that allows immense levels of mastery and value creation.

  But the development process hasn't fundamentally changed in decades and requires substantial time commitment and navigation through the ever-growing complexities it brings.

  We want to build tools that bring the focus back to the joyful process of building and creating—testing ideas, iterating, trying and even failing.

  And we're starting this with [Aide](/), an AI-powered IDE. We see AI not just as a tool, but a trusted partner willing and capable of doing all the heavy-lifting for you. Like a team member who has your back.
