    excerpt: `On Day 1 of my agent farmer journey, I bid farewell to our flagship product and dive headfirst into launching a new ad campaign with the help of some quirky automation. Between packing for a long-awaited reunion with family in India and last-minute code tweaks on the fly, this post captures the bittersweet blend of tech chaos, humor, and the moments that truly matter.`,

Gotta pack my stuff with lots of emotions going through my mind after we decided to sunset our main product. It's gonna feel nice to see my family in India after more than a year.

There is no time to idle, though. We need to get an ad campaign up and running for our new agent farm.

Fuck it – let's start from Bing, I got some minutes to spare and life doesn't really make sense, anyway. Within 5 minutes I am mostly done, but I need to add tracking tags to our landing page. Ugh, I am on my phone, I don't wanna open up my IDE now.

        I chose to be really lazy with it

I ask my agent to add the code I copy-pasted from the wizard (is that how they were called?) and continue packing. I get my toothbrush and put it next to my gf's – she put that there 24 hours ago.

When I unlock my phone again, the agent is done. Correct, correct, nice and... it forgot to add the tracking to both our CTAs. I add a comment to the PR, pack my laptop, and check again. Looks good, hit deploy, check Bing and cool – I am done.

My head spins a bit less – the person I care about is here, and home awaits. What other tasks could I give my agents while I'm flying?
